My [last post]({{< relref "../2024-07-20-treap/index.md" >}}) about the _Treap_
showed an implementation using tree rotations, as is commonly done with [AVL
Trees][avl] and [Red Black Trees][rb].

But the _Treap_ lends itself well to a simple and elegant implementation with no
tree rotations. This makes it especially easy to implement the removal of a key,
rather than the fiddly process of deletion using tree rotations.

## Implementation

All operations on the tree will be implemented in terms of two fundamental
operations: `split` and `merge`.

We'll be reusing the same structures as in the last post, so let's skip straight
to implementing those fundaments, and building on them for `insert` and
`delete`.
