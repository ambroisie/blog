The [_Bloom Filter_][wiki] is a probabilistic data structure for set membership.

The filter can be used as an inexpensive first step when querying the actual
data is quite costly (e.g: as a first check for expensive cache lookups or large
data seeks).

## What does it do?

A _Bloom Filter_ can be understood as a hash-set which can either tell you:

* An element is _not_ part of the set.
* An element _may be_ part of the set.

More specifically, one can tweak the parameters of the filter to make it so that
the _false positive_ rate of membership is quite low.

I won't be going into those calculations here, but they are quite trivial to
compute, or one can just look up appropriate values for their use case.
