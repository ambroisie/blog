The [_Bloom Filter_][wiki] is a probabilistic data structure for set membership.

The filter can be used as an inexpensive first step when querying the actual
data is quite costly (e.g: as a first check for expensive cache lookups or large
data seeks).

## What does it do?

A _Bloom Filter_ can be understood as a hash-set which can either tell you:

* An element is _not_ part of the set.
* An element _may be_ part of the set.

More specifically, one can tweak the parameters of the filter to make it so that
the _false positive_ rate of membership is quite low.

I won't be going into those calculations here, but they are quite trivial to
compute, or one can just look up appropriate values for their use case.

## Implementation

I'll be using Python, which has the nifty ability of representing bitsets
through its built-in big integers quite easily.

We'll be assuming a `BIT_COUNT` of 64 here, but the implementation can easily be
tweaked to use a different number, or even change it at construction time.

### Representation

A `BloomFilter` is just a set of bits and a list of hash functions.

```python
BIT_COUNT = 64

class BloomFilter[T]:
    _bits: int
    _hash_functions: list[Callable[[T], int]]

    def __init__(self, hash_functions: list[Callable[[T], int]]) -> None:
        # Filter is initially empty
        self._bits = 0
        self._hash_functions = hash_functions
```
