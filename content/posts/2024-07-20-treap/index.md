The [_Treap_][wiki] is a mix between a _Binary Search Tree_ and a _Heap_.

Like a _Binary Search Tree_, it keeps an ordered set of keys in the shape of a
tree, allowing for binary search traversal.

Like a _Heap_, it associates each node with a priority, making sure that a
parent's priority is always higher than any of its children.
